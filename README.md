# EnergyConservation

The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the development of smart homes and buildings that can be monitored and controlled remotely using IoT devices. These devices have the potential to optimize energy consumption and reduce energy waste, which is crucial for sustainability and cost savings. The proposed framework uses IoT devices to monitor visitor count and energy consumption, enabling real-time monitoring and control. The framework includes two microcontrollers, an Arduino Nano, and an IR sensor, which detects visitor presence and activates the light bulb using a relay module. The energy consumption of the connected appliance is monitored using an energy meter, which is connected to the Arduino Nano. The energy count is displayed on an LCD screen and sent to ThingSpeak.com for real-time monitoring and analysis. The black painted energy meter ensures accurate energy readings by preventing any external light interference. This report highlights the potential of IoT devices in energy conservation and the challenges associated with their implementation. It provides a comprehensive overview of the existing technologies and strategies used for energy management, including energy-efficient lighting systems, smart thermostats, and renewable energy sources. The report emphasizes the importance of energy conservation for environmental sustainability and cost savings. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of IoT devices in enhancing energy efficiency and visitor experience. It provides a flexible and scalable platform for energy monitoring and control, enabling users to optimize their energy consumption and reduce energy waste. It also  highlights the importance of energy conservation for environmental sustainability and cost savings and provides a comprehensive overview of the existing technologies and strategies used for energy management.
